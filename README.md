#TODO:

##now-ish
- when loading data (e.g. C major scale), loader needs to communicate with saver (how? through parent? through a wrapper in pkg?)
- up/down arrow to move through results, enter to select
- click to select result = load that music as preview (or maybe just going up and down?)
- ok = confirm preview?
- pass less data in query?
- automatically close form after loading?


##later
- toggle on blur (if .form is visible)
